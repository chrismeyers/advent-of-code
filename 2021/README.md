# 2021 puzzles

Puzzles can be solved by using `solver.mjs` and specifying a day number and an optional part number. Omitting the part number runs all parts for the given day. The solver can be invoked in the following ways:
```sh
$ node solver.mjs 1
$ node . 2
$ ./solver.mjs 2 1
```

Templates can be generated for a new day by using `generator.mjs` and specifying a day number. The generator can be invoked in the following ways:
```sh
$ node generator.mjs 1
$ ./generator.mjs 2
```
