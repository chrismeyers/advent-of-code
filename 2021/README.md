# 2021 puzzles

Puzzles can be solved by using `solver.js` and specifying a problem number and an optional part number. Omitting the part number runs all parts for the given problem number. The solver can be invoked in the following ways:
```sh
$ node solver.js 1
$ node solver 1 1
$ node . 2
$ ./solver.js 2 1
```
